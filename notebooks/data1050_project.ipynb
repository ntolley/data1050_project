    "For the corrupted URLs, we are going to assume that there is one intended URL in 'products.csv'. To pair corrupted URLs to real URLs, we will utilize the \"edit distance\" to identify how many insertions, deletions, or character changes are necessary to transform a corrupted URL into one of the true URLs. Formally this is referred to a Levenshtein distance  \n",

    "To gather all the publication URLs, we need to combine information from `log2.csv` and `products.csv`. Since 'publication_URL' is present in both tables. To do this, we will first define a simple mapping function `get_pub_url()` that 1) looks up the product URL associated with a specific product name, and 2) use that product_URL to find and return all the publication URLs in the log file."

While there are ways to construct this in a SQL database, it would be difficult to apply filtering functions with the WHERE operator in this format. Instead the better solution is to create a separate table called `product_type_pubURLS` which just contains the fields of `product_type` and `publication_URL` to list out all pairs that appear in the log file. While this creates a table with a large number of rows, this approach avoids redundancy and makes the table accessible to data extraction operations. "

    "a) Best by sentiment context\n",
    "Baed on our analysis, ads for products using a neutral sentiment context appear to perform best across the board relative to positive and negative sentiment contexts. This conclusion comes from looking at the average click rate across all products for each sentiment context. We found that average neutral context clickrate was 0.60, and positive = 0.44 and negative = 0.46. This difference was found to be statistically significant by Tukey's HSD. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based in individual product performance, we reccomend ads for face cream in the neutral and negative sentiments contexts as they produced of clickrates of 0.93 and 0.90 respectively. On the other hand, we do not recoomend showing ads for pressure cookers in a negative sentiment context, which had the worst performance such that not a single person clicked on these ads.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Best by sentiment context and gender\n",
    "Based on our analysis, when averaging across all products there seems to be no correlation between click rate and sentiment context when controlling for gender. This comes from a pairwise Tukey HSD test which produced no signficant differences between any two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on individual product performance, face cream still performs the best when controlling for gender. Specifically, men click on face cream ads in a neutral sentiment context at a rate of 0.94. Interestingly, the 2nd best is pressure cookers in a neutral sentiment context as women click on these ads at a rate of 0.93.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast pressure cookers in a negative sentiment context perform the worst for men and women with a click rate of zero, suggesting that the sentiment context is in fact very important when selling pressure cookers.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Best by sentiment context and age group\n",
    "Based on our analysis, when averaging across all products we see that sentiment context and age group very rarely produce significant differences. Of the 144 possible pairwise comparisons, only 6 were significant by Tukey's HSD. This included neutral_juvenile : positive_juvenile \n",
    "neutral_middle-age : positive_juvenile \n",
    "neutral_senior : positive_juvenile \n",
    "neutral_senior : positive_middle-age \n",
    "neutral_young : positive_juvenile \n",
    "neutral_young : positive_middle-age \n",
    "\n",
    "Taking into account that the large number of error corrections produces a much more rigorous p-value correction (making only the strongest effects visible), we see that the previous conclusion holds where neutral context frequently performs significantly better than other contexts (positive in this case) when controlling for age group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on individual product performance, we see that face cream ads towards young/juvenile users should be prioritized as they have clickrates of 1 and 0.95 respectively in neutral contexts. Additionally pants advertisements in a neutral context should be targeted at middle-aged users as they also have a perfect clickrate. On the other hand pressure cookers should never be advertised in a negative sentiment context as they have a click rate of zero for all age groups. We additionally do not reccomend showing rowing machine ads to juveniles in a neutral sentiment context, or vitamin ads to juveniles in a positive context which additionally had click rates of zero."
